# Superstore-Data-Analysis
This project presents an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a retail Superstore sales dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover key business insights such as sales trends, top-performing products, regional sales patterns, and customer contributions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyse monthly sales trends
- Identify top-performing products and customers
- Explore regional and category-wise sales patterns
- Visualise sales distribution across categories

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
- Columns: `Order Date`, `Sales`, `Region`, `Product Name`, `Category`, `Customer Name`, etc.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.12
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Visualizations

- Monthly sales trend (line chart)
- Top 10 products (horizontal bar chart)
- Sales by region (bar chart)
- Category-wise sales distribution (box plot)
- Top 5 customers (bar chart)

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Superstore Data Analysis

Based on the analysis and visualisations performed, here are some key insights:

- **📈 Monthly Sales Trend**  
  The monthly sales trend shows a clear **seasonality**, with peaks typically occurring towards the end of the year (**November and December**). There appears to be **consistent growth over the years**, although there are fluctuations month-to-month.

- **🔥 Top 10 Selling Products**  
  The analysis of top-selling products highlights that **high-value items like copiers and binding machines** contribute significantly to overall sales.

- **🌍 Sales by Region**  
  The **West and East** regions have the highest sales figures, while the **South and Central** regions have lower sales. This suggests potential areas for **targeted marketing or sales efforts** in the underperforming regions.

- **📦 Sales Distribution by Category**  
  The box plot of sales distribution by category indicates that **'Technology' products** generally have a **higher sales range** and potentially more **outliers (high-value sales)** compared to 'Furniture' and 'Office Supplies'. This aligns with the observation about top-selling products being high-value technology items.

- **👤 Top 5 Customers by Sales**  
  The top 5 customers represent a **significant portion of the total sales**, indicating the importance of maintaining **strong relationships with these high-value customers**.
